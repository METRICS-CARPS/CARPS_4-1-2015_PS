## Article ID: 4-1-2015 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 1.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> We complemented our by-face analysis with a by-participant
repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with DFT as a repeated measure and judgment
type (trustworthiness vs. attractiveness) as a between-subjects
factor. The observed effects supported the same
conclusions as the by-face analysis. The main effect of
DFT was significant, F(10, 37) = 4.05, p < .001, ηp2 = .52.
More important, this main effect was qualified by a significant
interaction, F(10, 37) = 5.95, p < .001, ηp2 = .62.
